        <h3>I began taking Geekwise courses a couple months ago. I am interested in the coding and development of websites and softwares and wish to soon acquire a career in this field of study. Technology is a very large part of my life and I enjoy getting to learn what's under the hood of so many of the programs and softwares that I interact with in my everyday life. The possibilities with coding are seemingly endless and it is exciting that there is always something more complex and advanced to push toward. I've done some work with bootstrap previously and wish to revise and refine my skills with the use of this framework with the help of this class.</h3>
