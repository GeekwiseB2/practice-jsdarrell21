        <h3>I began taking Geekwise courses 6 weeks ago. I was interested in following a career path that did not require the full amount of schooling that many other careers would require to be done. Technology is a very large part of my life and I enjoy getting to learn what's under the hood of so many of the programs and softwares that I interact with in my everyday life. The possibilities with coding are seemingly endless and it is exciting that there is always something more complex and advanced to push toward. I'm looking forward to what this class will add to my knowledge of the coding language.</h3>
